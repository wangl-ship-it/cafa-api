/**
 * Where every throw becomes a response.
 *
 * The direct counterpart of veyra_api's `GlobalExceptionFilter`. Controllers
 * and services never build an error response themselves — they throw, and this
 * is the single place that decides what a thrown thing looks like on the wire.
 *
 * The default arm is deliberately 500 with the real message. This is a
 * one-person admin behind a GitHub account check; an operator reading the true
 * cause in the network tab is worth more than hiding it from an attacker who
 * would have to be signed in as the studio to see it at all.
