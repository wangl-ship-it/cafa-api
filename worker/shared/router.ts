/**
 * The route table.
 *
 * A Worker has no attribute routing, so this is the nearest honest equivalent:
 * `allowAnonymous` and `authorize` are `[AllowAnonymous]` and `[Authorize]`,
 * and a template like `/api/revisions/:id/restore` is `[HttpPost("{id}/restore")]`.
 * Declaring which routes need a session *at registration* is the point — the
 * previous shape decided it with a `path.startsWith('/api/')` check halfway down
 * a 453-line handler, which is a rule you have to reconstruct by reading.
 *
 * Matching is exact on segment count, so `/api/content` and
 * `/api/content/published` cannot shadow one another however they are ordered.
