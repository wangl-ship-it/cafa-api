/**
 * The envelope every authenticated endpoint answers in.
 *
 * Four fields, the same four veyra_api's `Shared/Models/ApiResponse.cs` uses:
 * `success` is what a client branches on, `code` mirrors the HTTP status so a
 * caller that only has the body still knows what happened, `msg` is safe to put
 * in front of a person, and `data` is the payload or null.
 *
 * The one field veyra does not have is `problems`, and it earns its place: this
 * admin's entire job is refusing a save that would produce content the site
 * cannot build, and "which field, on which record" is the answer the editor
 * draws. Folding that into `msg` would make the client parse prose.
 *
 * The two build-time endpoints are deliberately *not* wrapped — see
 * worker/controllers/public-content.controller.ts for why.
