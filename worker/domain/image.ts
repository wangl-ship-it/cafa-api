/**
 * What is true about a photograph before anything stores it.
 *
 * Pure functions over bytes and keys: no bucket, no database, nothing async.
 * The bucket is worker/storage/media-storage.ts and the registry row is
 * worker/repositories/media.repository.ts; this is the part both of them agree
 * about, which is why it is the only one of the three that can be reasoned
 * about — or tested — without a binding.
 *
 * Dimensions are read out of the uploaded bytes rather than taken from the
 * browser that sent them. They are not decoration: the template turns them into
 * the aspect box that holds a slot open before an image arrives, and a wrong
 * number there is layout shift on the live site. A value the site's CLS budget
 * depends on should be derived from the file, not from a form field.
 *
 * Reading a JPEG or PNG header is forty lines. Decoding the image is not
 * possible in a Worker anyway — there is no sharp here — so this is not a
 * shortcut around a better option, it is the only correct one.
