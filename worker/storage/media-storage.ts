 * The bucket.
 *
 * Separate from worker/repositories/media.repository.ts on purpose, and for the
 * same reason veyra_api keeps `Storage/S3TalentMediaStorage.cs` apart from its
 * DbContext: one of them holds bytes and the other holds a row about those
 * bytes, and they fail in different ways. The service that uses both is the
 * place that knows the order — object first, then row, because a row pointing
 * at an object that is not there yet is the only ordering that can break a build.
