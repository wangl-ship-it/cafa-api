/**
 * The shape of the content the studio owns.
 *
 * This mirrors CAFA-Template's `src/lib/types.ts`, and deliberately diverges
 * from it in two places — both of which are the same idea, that the admin's
 * types should describe what the admin can actually change:
 *
 *  - **`SiteContent` has no `nav`, `locales` or `localeNames`.** Those are wired
 *    to the template's lib/routes.ts and to the deployment. worker/domain/bundle.ts
 *    adds them when it builds a published revision, so the template still
 *    receives the complete record it expects.
 *  - **`Dictionary` has `nav` and `localeName`, which the template's does not.**
 *    The *shape* of the nav is code; the *words* in it are copy, and the studio
 *    should be able to rename an item without a deploy. They are stored as copy
 *    rows and lifted back out into `site` by worker/domain/bundle.ts.
 *
 * The copy cannot drift dangerously in either direction: the template re-parses
 * every field at build time, so a mismatch fails the build and never reaches
 * the live site.
