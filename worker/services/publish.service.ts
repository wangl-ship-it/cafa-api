/**
 * Publishing, and everything that answers "is it live yet".
 *
 * The publishing model, in one paragraph. Saving writes the live tables — that
 * is the draft, and it is what the preview build reads. Publishing snapshots
 * those tables into an append-only `revision` row and pokes a Cloudflare deploy
 * hook, and the production build reads the newest revision. So the draft/main
 * branch pair became live-tables/newest-revision, "how far ahead is the draft"
 * became "does the draft differ from the newest revision", and the commit SHA
 * in build-info.json became a revision number.
 *
 * Everything here compares two bundles as strings. That works because
 * `buildBundle` is deterministic over the same content — same key order, same
 * projection — so equality of the JSON is equality of the published result, and
 * "nothing to publish" needs no diffing.
